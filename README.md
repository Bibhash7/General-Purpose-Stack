# General-Purpose-Stack
This library supports all data types & operations of Stack (like C++ STL Stack) with few extra functionalities:
1. bottom(): Returns the bottom element
2. reverse(): Reverse the entire stack
3. Overloaded left shift operator (<<) to display the stack in stack form. (Works for basic data types and string only, not for vector and arrays.)

The Code is tested well on different senerios: basic data types, vector, set, string etc:

Happy Coding :)
